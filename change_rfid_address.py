# Example 3
#
# This example code demonstrates how to change the address of the Qwiic RFID Tag
# Reader to one of your choosing. There is a set range of available addresses from
# 0x07 to 0x78, so make sure your chosen address falls within this range.

import qwiic_rfid
import time
import sys

# If you've already changed the I2C address, change this to the current address!
currentAddress = qwiic_rfid._AVAILABLE_I2C_ADDRESS[0]
